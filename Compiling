Prerequisites:
galvanic Lucifer requires the following libraries to be 
installed (Together with their development headers) 
before it can be compiled. 

Boost		http://www.boost.org (Should be in the standard 
		package repositories for Linux).
Zita Resampler 	http://www.kokkinizita.net/linuxaudio/zita-resampler/resampler.html
log4cpp 	http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/ (Should also be 
		in the standard repositories for your distro)
QT4 		http://qt.nokia.com (Should definitely be in the standard 
		repositories if on Linux).
Freetype	(Not yet, but it is coming).

For changes to the build system you will need cmake.

For compilation you will need a make plus whatever your usual c++ toolchain is. 

Have Fun.
